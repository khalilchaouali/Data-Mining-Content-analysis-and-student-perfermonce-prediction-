# Data-Mining-Content-analysis-and-student-perfermonce-prediction-<br>
This project is came under my engineering internship at GoMyCode which is an e-learning platforme<br>
This is it's architecture <br>
each track has a super skills(chapter) in each skills super we found skills .<br>
In each track we find 3 type of quiz to evaluate their students<br>
** 1-assessments**<br>
** 2-checkpoints**<br>
** 3-one to one quiz**<br>
## Objective<br>
Analyse business problème related to course content and predict student performance<br>
    • Extract, clean and transform unstructured students records data using Neo4j and data preprocessing techniques.<br>
    • help with knowledge discovery of 2000 students , support decision-making.<br>
    • Prepare documentation, reports, and presentations that explain advanced analytics concepts, technology, and inner workings of solutions to broader teams<br>
    • Develop and maintain models to identify which students will face problems in their future learning .
